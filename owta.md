## About OWTA's

`OWTA` = Open World Text Adventure

The assumption is that learning skills can be approached *as a Text Adventure*.
Lacking specific *quests*, we just have fun in the *Open World*.

You can think of an OWTA as similar to a *getting started guide* or a *beginner strategy guide* inside a (reasonably) well-defined *sandbox*.

In the **Setup**-section of an OWTA there should be just enough information on how to *enter the sandbox*.

Then, with just a few very specific *magical incantations* (text-commands), you can **Start Exploring** and get the journey going. These early commands give you a hint of which *rabbit-holes* you could dive into and since it's an *Open World Text Adventure* you should feel every inclination to do so.

Once you're feeling in need of some extra guidance or new rabbitholes to explore, browsing the OWTA should provide you with new ideas.

## Overview

Keep in mind this series is still (very) young.
