Today I made this account.
It is meant for exploring roguelike and other cRPG-related code.

Introducing [`OWTA`s AKA **Open World Text Adventures**](owta.md) as a metaphor for learning new skills.

My initial goal is to have a dozen orso experimental OWTA-setups.

They are meant to hit a similar vein to *awesome lists*, *code kata's*, *learnxinyminutes*, ... but with a focus on a more exploratory mindset.

Initially I wanted to call them `LaaOWTA`'s as in *Learn `XYZ` as an Open World Text Adventure* but that's just a cumbersome acronym.

The first one: https://github.com/roguebro/powershell

The potentially life-long exploration of (Neo)Vim-features surely deserves its own OWTA: https://github.com/roguebro/nvim
